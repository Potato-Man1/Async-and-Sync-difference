When you run the sync one it should give you this

  start task 1 
                <---Now between this two lines it has a window of 5 seconds of time. In that time your computer does nothing
                    Bit of enifficient right? With the asyncio we can told our computer to use the 5 seconds to do something else other than wait.
  task 1 done! 
  1
  1
  1
  1
  1 <--- This ones takes 1 second to be printed each. In total of 10 seconds.

  start task 2 
               <--This has 4 second of time window which again bit of a waste of time.
  task 2 done! 
  [Finished in 19.8s]
  
Now if we run that has  asyncio.

  start task 1
  start task 2 <--- Notice that in async there is a line between the task 1 and task is done!
  1                 it means that in the 5 seconds window the computer move to another task to do              
  1                 which is task 2 but task 2 takes 4 seconds to get done. So it searches for other task which
  1                 is the For loop of ones.
  task 2 done!
  1
  task 1 is done!
  1
  1         <--- At this point the only task is not done is the for loop of ones and so it finishes it.

  1
  [Finished in 12.8s] <-- Notice that it gets faster
  
  Notice how is uses every bit of time it gets to run the code.
  So using asyncio can make your code runs faster to do many tasks like this one.
